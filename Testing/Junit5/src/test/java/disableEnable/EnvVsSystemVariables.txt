1) We can update Properties at runtime while Environment Variables are an immutable copy of the Operating System's variables.
2) Properties are contained only within Java platform while Environment Variables are global at the Operating System level â€“
    available to all applications running on the same machine.
3) Properties must exist when packaging the application
    but we can create Environment Variables on the Operating System at almost any point.
