>>What is?
When you have multiple sets of objects, where objects in one set work together,
then you can use abstract factory pattern, to isolate client code from
concrete objects & their factories

>>Implementation Consideration
When you want to constrain object creations so that they all work together

>>Examples
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory

>>Pitfalls
lot more complex to implement than factory method.
adding a new product requires changes to based factory and all its implementations
very specific to "product families"
