When we want to move the object creation logic from our coe to a separate class
Class instantiation is dynamic via Inheritance hierarchy

Design Consideration
Template Method & "abstract factory" design pattern makes use of factory method pattern
"Subclasses providing the actual instance"
Base class defines the factory method and subclasses of this class,
will actually provide the concrete implementation (object) of that particular class


Examples
java.util.Collection or AbstractCollection => iterator > ArrayList, LinkedList

Pitfalls
More complex to implement
This design must be used from beginning
