Most used pattern - indirectly in Spring
A singleton class has only one instance, accessible globally through a single point (via a method/field)
Only single instance of this class, means "global state"

Early and Lazy initialization

Example
java.lang.Runtime in rt.jar

Singleton vs Factory Method

Pitfall
difficult to mock and unit test
singleton with large mutable global state is bad practice
