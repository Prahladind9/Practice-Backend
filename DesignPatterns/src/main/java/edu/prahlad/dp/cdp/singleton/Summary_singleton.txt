Most used pattern
A singleton class has only one instance, accessible globally through a single point (via a method/field)
Only single instance of this class, means "global state"

Early and Lazy initialization

Example
java.text.NumberFormat

Simple Factory vs Factory Method

Pitfall
Criteria - to instantiate can be more convoluted/complex over time
    > if we see this happening then we should move to Factory Method
