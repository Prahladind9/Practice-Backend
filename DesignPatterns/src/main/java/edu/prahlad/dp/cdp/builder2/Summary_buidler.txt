Think of builder patten when you have a complex constructor
or an object is built in multiple steps

Builder1 - implementation can be referred for the legacy code impl
Builder2 - modern or popular impl

Builder Pattern
1) StringBuilder Class - satisfies only the intent/purpose of builder pattern
    Not 100% complaint by GOF
2) Java 8 - java.util.Calendar.Builder


Builder vs Prototype

Pitfalls
nothing major but, bit complex impl - method chaining could be confusing for newbie
