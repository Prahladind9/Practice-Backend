Not a design pattern - not to be confused with factory method design pattern
> this way of building class is simply a method that encapsulates object instantiation
Nothing complex goes on in that method

Example
java.text.NumberFormat

Simple Factory vs Factory Method

Pitfall
Criteria - to instantiate can be more convoluted/complex over time
    > if we see this happening then we should move to Factory Method
