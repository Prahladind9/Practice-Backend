We need to provide a placeholder or surrogate to another object.
Proxy acts on behalf of the object and is used for lots of reasons .. they are:
Protection Proxy    - Control access to original object's operations
Remote Proxy        - Provides a local representation of a remote object
Virtual Proxy       - Delays construction of original object until absolutely necessary

We have State & Dynamic Proxy

Example
Spring uses proxy pattern to provide support for features like
transactions, caching and general AOP support.

Proxy vs Decorator

Pitfall
If you need proxies for handling multiple responsibilities like
auditing, authentication, as a stand-in for the same instance,
then it's better to have a single proxy to handle all these requirements.
Due to the way some proxies create object on their own, it becomes quite difficult to manage them.
