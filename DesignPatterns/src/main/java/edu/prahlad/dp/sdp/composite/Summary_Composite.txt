We have a part-whole relationship or hierarchy of objects and
we want to be able to treat all objects in this hierarchy uniformly.

You can provide a method to access parent of a node.
This will simplify traversal of the entire tree

Example
Composite is used in many UI frameworks, since it easily allows to represent a tree of UI controls.
JSF

Composite vs Decorator

Pitfall
Difficult to restrict what is added to hierarchy.
