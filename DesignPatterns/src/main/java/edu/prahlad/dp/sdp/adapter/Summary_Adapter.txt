1) Class adapter/ Two way adapter (Not preferred)
2) Object Adapter - best way
Composition instead of Inheritance

Shouldn avoid overriding the adaptee object methods

Example
java.io.InputStreamReader & OutputStreamReader in rt.jar

Adapter vs Decorator

Pitfall
Class adapter - as both interface and adaptee class extend our adapter,
we can create a "class adapter" -
which pollutes the code as unrelated methods are exposed in parts of code.

Adaptee Object shouldn't be changed
