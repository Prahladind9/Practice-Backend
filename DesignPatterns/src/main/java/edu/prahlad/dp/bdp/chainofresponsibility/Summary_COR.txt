Chain of Responsibility

When we want to decouple sender of request from the object which handles the request,
we use chain of responsibility.
We want this decoupling because we want to give multiple objects chance to handle the request &
we don't know all objects before hand.

We create objects which are chained together by one object knowing reference of object,
which is next in chain.
We give request to first object in chain, if it can't handle that it simply passes
the request down the chain.

Example
All servlet filters >> javax.servlet.Filter

Chain of Responsibility vs Command

Pitfall
There is no guarantee provided in the pattern that a request will be handled.
Request can traverse whole chain and fall at the other end without ever being processed
and we won't know it.
