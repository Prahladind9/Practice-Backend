Introduction to Java Programming & Data Structures - 2020

Chapter 2
Software Development Process
The software development life cycle is a multistage process that includes
requirements, specification, analysis, design, implementation, testing,
deployment, and maintenance

Chapter 5 > Loops
Chapter 6 > Methods
    Stepwise refinement
    1) Simpler Program
    2) Reusing Methods
    3) Easier Developing, Debugging and Testing
    4) Better Facilitating Teamwork

Chapter 7 > Single-Dimensional Arrays (DataStructure)
 10)Searching Arrays
    Linear Search
    Binary Search
        1) If the key is less than the middle element, you need to continue to search for the key
            only in the first half of the array.
        2) If the key is equal to middle element, the search ends with a match.
        3) If the key is greater than the middle element, you need to continue to search for the
            key only in the second half of the array
 11)Sorting Arrays

Chapter 8 > Multidimensional Arrays
