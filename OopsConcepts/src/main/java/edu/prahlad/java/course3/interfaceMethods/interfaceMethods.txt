Default Methods
------------------
Before Java 8, we could only declare abstract methods in an interface.
However, Java 8 introduced the concept of the default methods.
"Default methods are methods that cam have a body".
The most important use of default methods in interfaces is to provide additional
functionality to a given type without breaking down the implementing classes.

Static Methods
------------------
The static methods in interfaces are similar to default methods but
the only difference is that you can't override them

Functional Interface
--------------------
An interface that has a single abstract method is called a functional interface.
While an interface can have one or more default methods,
it should compulsory and only have one abstract method to be called a functional interface.
